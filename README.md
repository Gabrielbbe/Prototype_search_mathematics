## Prototype of a search engine of latex code in scientific articles

Imagine you could search mathematical formulas in scientific articles, it could be useful to search solutions of mathematical problems you're facing and help 
people from different areas to solve different problems using the same math, it also could be used to study the aplications of mathematics in different areas
of science.

In this repo I read 3 different scientific articles and transformed it from pdf to english text and latex code using the pipeline in the repo :

Example of search :
